# About

This project contains reference material for syntax, concepts and context for working as a technologist.

Its primary objective is to assist its author with understanding the material referenced. 

More complete / authoratative references can be found elsewhere and will be cited within the individual documents themselves or within a consolidated SOURCES.md file.

In many cases the content of this project is a revision and reincorporation of documentation found in the sources referenced, and as such the author of this repositiory can be thought of as a contributing editor. 

Please open an issue if you see content that you believe is not properly attributed.

# Conventions

As of March 2019 no one style or method of organization is **yet** uniform throughout the reference pages in this repo. Going forward, documents should follow the conventions listed here and reformatting should be completed along these lines.

- Documents are in Markdown to simplify composition and static site generation.
- Conceptual, terminological, or specific technology references should use italics, such as *RESTful*, *callback* or *git*. Long term, a glossary will be assembled using [*test*](terms.md/test)
- All code should be back ticked inline or in code blocks.
- Bold will be used for **emphasis**.
