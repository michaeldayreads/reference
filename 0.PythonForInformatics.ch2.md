2.1 Type the following statements in the Python interpreter to see what they do:

    5
    x = 5
    x + 1

>H:  
5  
[nothing]  
6  
&nbsp;  
O:  
5  
[nothing]  
6

2.2 Write a program that uses raw_input to prompt a user for their name and then welcomes them

    name = raw_input('Please tell us your name: ')  
    print 'Welcome to exercise 2.2 ' + name + '.'

2.3 Write a program to prompt the user for hours and rate per hour to compute gross pay.

    # we have not covered control structures - using only what covered thus far  
    hours = int(raw_input('Enter hours: '))  
    rate = int(raw_input('Enter rate: '))  
    pay = hours * rate  
    print pay  

2.4 width = 17 height = 12.0 -- Write the value of the following expressions and the type:

width/2

>H:  
8  
int
&nbsp;  

    # observed
    width = 17
    height = 12.0
    print width/2
    8
    type(width/2)
    <type 'int'>

width/2.0

>H:  
8.5  
float  

    #observed
    width = 17
    height = 12.0
    print width/2.0
    8.5
    type(width/2.0)
    <type 'float'>

height/3

>H:  
4.0  
float  

    #observed
    width = 17
    height = 12.0
    print height/3
    4.0
    type(height/3)
    <type 'float'>

1 + 2 * 5

>H:  
11  
int

    #observed
    1 + 2 * 5
    11
    type(1 + 2 * 5)
    <type 'int'>

2.5 Write a program that prompts for C, converts to F and outputs F.

    c = int(raw_input('Degrees Celcius? '))
    f = c * 9.0 / 5 + 32 # one float means result is float
    print str(c) + ' degrees celcius is ' + str(f) + ' degrees Fahrenheit.' 
    # inferred str() from introduction of int()
