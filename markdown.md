Its easy to have links to webpages like [this one](https://pinboard.in/u:michaeldayreads).

Its also easy to refer to other documents in the same repo, for example we can refer to the [vim](vim.md) doc.

We can use this as a hack to create a source list, for example we could cite [Day (2018)](day_2018)
