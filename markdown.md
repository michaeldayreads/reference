### Effective Markdown

In addition to formatting cribs and usage examples, this document contains conventions used in markdown documents in this repo and within my username space on GitHub.

#### Links, Sources and Footnotes

Its easy to have links to webpages like [this one](https://pinboard.in/u:michaeldayreads).

```
[this one](https://pinboard.in/u:michaeldayreads)
```

Its also easy to refer to other documents in the same repo, for example we can refer to the [vim](vim.md) doc.

```
[vim](vim.md)
```

Similarly we can link to headers within the present document. This means we can call out other sections, such as [the top of our document](#Effective)

```
[the top of our document](#Effective)
```

We can use this as a hack to create a source list.

For example we could reference a particular work using a link format following an Author_Year convention such as [Carse 1986](#Carse_1986). 

Similarly, we can create footnotes using the `<sup></sup>` HTML tags as we've done here <sup>[1](#1)</sup> as a footnote.
